## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A UI and API end points which allows the user to enter a letter and get following details:
1. Number of cities beginning with that letter
2. City names beginning with that letter

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites and installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install Anaconda on your system.
    Follow instructions given on link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

2. Clone repository on your system

3. Setup Virtual Environment
  It is always a good practice if you create a separate python/conda environment for new project.
  The default environment, which ``conda`` itself is install into is called ``base``. To create another environment, use the ``conda create`` command.

  Note:- You can create python virtual environment as well, however I prefer conda and hence below instructions are for Conda environment setup.

  For instance, to create an environment you would run
  ```
  conda create -n city-details python=3.9
  ```
  This creates an environment called ``city-details`` with python version 3.9.
  We can now activate this environment, use
  ```
  # On newer versions of conda (v4.6 or later)
  conda activate city-details

  # on older versions of conda
  source activate city-details
  ```

  Once you are in newly created environment, next step is to install the dependency packages from ``requirements.txt``
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  

Download sample dataset of world cities from below link:
[simplemaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)

Download the ``worldcities.csv`` file from above link and keep it under data directory.
There is a script available data/load_csv.py to load this data in MongoDB.

```
cd city-details/data
python load_csv.py
```

Note :- You can skip above step if you have access of pre-loaded database.


### Place ``.env`` file in project directory. You can rename the existing .env-example file to .env as well.

Add MONGODB_URL in .env file.


## Running the project <a name = "run"></a>

```
cd city-details
python -m city_details
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the project is up and running, by default it accepts traffic from all hosts i.e. ``0.0.0.0`` and detault port is ``8086``

- Try to open the URL: [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086)



## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

First create wheel bundle of the project using following command:
```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
Above command will generate a dist directory and a wheel file inside it.
This file contains entire build of this system (except .env and tests).
You can distribute this wheel file on any of the server and just install it in any environment:
```
pip install city_details-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
You need to put .env file on the system to start the project and connect to the MongoDB.


To deploy this project on production, we need to run it behind gunicorn.
